#  Comment Harvester

Gather comments from Java, Processing, Javascript, C++, and Python source files. Optionally, sort comments by content
(i.e. collect all 'TODO's, etc.).

Ultimately, the project aims to become a very basic (and, for the most part, language agnostic) system for generating documentation from comments.
Analogous to javadocs, doxygen, etc.

### Checklist

##### support for wide range of language filetypes (i.e. .java, .cpp, etc.).
##### create JavaFX user interface to configure requirements and to display results
##### send results to .pdf or .doc or .txt

##### Currently, the program works from the command line and picks out a single type of comment (containing 'TODO:')

NOTES:
    1. Build with JDK 21 or later.
